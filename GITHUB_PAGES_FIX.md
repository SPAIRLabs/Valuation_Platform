# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages - Show Website Instead of README

## ✅ Problem Identified
GitHub Pages is serving the root README.md instead of your built React app.

## 🚀 Solution: Use GitHub Actions

### Step 1: Push Your Code (Run This Now)
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages Settings

1. **Go to your repository:**
   https://github.com/SPAIRLabs/Valuation_Platform

2. **Click "Settings" tab**

3. **In left sidebar, click "Pages"**

4. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - **Source:** Select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - Click Save

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the workflow to run

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Actions tab:**
   https://github.com/SPAIRLabs/Valuation_Platform/actions
   
2. **Look for:**
   - "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Green checkmark ✅ = Success
   - Red X ❌ = Failed (click for details)

3. **Once successful, visit:**
   https://spairlabs.github.io/Valuation_Platform/

## 🎯 Why This Works

Your repository includes:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Automatic build & deploy
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Configured for `/Valuation_Platform/` base path
- ✅ React app in `document-editor/` folder

GitHub Actions will:
1. Checkout your code
2. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
3. Build React app (`npm run build`)
4. Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue 1: Workflow Not Running
**Symptom:** No "Deploy to GitHub Pages" in Actions tab

**Fix:**
- Make sure `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` was pushed
- Check Settings → Pages → Source is "GitHub Actions"
- Try manually triggering: Actions tab → "Deploy to GitHub Pages" → "Run workflow"

### Issue 2: Build Fails
**Symptom:** Red X in Actions tab

**Fix:**
1. Click the failed workflow
2. Check error messages
3. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies → Check `package.json`
   - TypeScript errors → Run `npm run build` locally first
   - Wrong paths → Verify folder structure

### Issue 3: 404 on Assets
**Symptom:** Site loads but CSS/JS shows 404

**Fix:**
- Verify `base` in `vite.config.ts` is: `/Valuation_Platform/`
- Must match your repository name exactly
- Must end with `/` slash

## 📋 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] Workflow runs successfully (green checkmark)
- [ ] Site loads at https://spairlabs.github.io/Valuation_Platform/

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Check the Workflow File
Make sure `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists in your repository:
https://github.com/SPAIRLabs/Valuation_Platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

### Manually Trigger Deployment
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" (left sidebar)
3. Click "Run workflow" button (right side)
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

### View Build Logs
1. Actions tab → Click latest workflow run
2. Click "build" job
3. Expand each step to see detailed logs
4. Look for errors in red
